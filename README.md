Project Description:
This project deals with all possible tasks which are performed while using an E-pharmaceutical application. 
The main objective of this project is to create a software which performs all types of data handling and visualizations. 
We can also manipulate or add the data.

This project is single user software which is to be used in government offices. 
It can store as many records as entered by user because we are storing the data in a CSV file.
